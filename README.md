 ## Python Flask Expert Assistant

### Problem Analysis
The problem at hand is to build a maths tutorial site using Python Flask. This site will provide interactive tutorials on various mathematical concepts, allowing users to learn and practice math in a user-friendly environment.

### Flask Application Design
To achieve this, we will design a Flask application with the following structure:

#### HTML Files
1. **index.html**: This will serve as the homepage of the site, providing an overview of the available tutorials and links to access them.
2. **tutorial.html**: This template will be used to display individual tutorials. It will include the tutorial content, interactive elements, and navigation options.
3. **base.html**: This layout template will provide a consistent structure for all pages, including the header, footer, and navigation bar.

#### Routes
1. **@app.route('/')**: This route will handle requests for the homepage and display the index.html file.
2. **@app.route('/tutorial/<topic>'**: This route will handle requests for specific tutorials. It will dynamically generate the tutorial.html file based on the specified topic.
3. **@app.route('/submit_answer', methods=['POST'])**: This route will handle form submissions for interactive elements within the tutorials. It will process the user's input and provide feedback or further instructions.

### Additional Considerations
- The application can be further enhanced by incorporating user authentication and progress tracking features.
- To make the tutorials interactive, JavaScript libraries or frameworks can be integrated to create dynamic and engaging content.
- The application can be deployed on a cloud platform or a web hosting service to make it accessible online.

This design provides a solid foundation for building a maths tutorial site using Python Flask. By following this structure, you can create an effective and user-friendly learning platform for mathematical concepts.
